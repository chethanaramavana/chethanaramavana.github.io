Welcome to my blog! I'm Chethana R V, a PhD researcher at Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, specializing in Quantum Cryptography and Post-Quantum Cryptography.

## What to Expect

This blog will serve as a platform to share my research insights and educational content on topics that lie at the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and cryptography. I plan to write about:

### Kolmogorov Complexity

Kolmogorov complexity, also known as algorithmic complexity, measures the computational resources needed to specify an object. It has profound implications for:

- Understanding randomness and compressibility
- Foundations of information theory
- Connections to cryptographic security

### One-way Functions

One-way functions are the fundamental building blocks of modern cryptography. These are functions that are:

- Easy to compute in one direction
- Computationally infeasible to invert

I'll explore their theoretical foundations, candidates, and implications for cryptographic constructions.

### Post-Quantum Cryptography

With quantum computers on the horizon, we need to understand:

- How quantum algorithms threaten current cryptographic systems
- What makes certain cryptographic schemes quantum-resistant
- The NIST post-quantum standardization process

### Block Ciphers and Symmetric Cryptography

Building on my IEEE publication, I'll discuss:

- Block cipher design principles
- Security analysis techniques
- Post-quantum considerations for symmetric cryptography

## Stay Tuned

I'll be posting regularly on these topics, combining rigorous mathematical treatment with accessible explanations. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a student, or simply curious about cryptography, I hope you'll find something valuable here.

Feel free to reach out if you have questions or topics you'd like me to cover!
