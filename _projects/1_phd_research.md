## Research Overview

My doctoral research at Dayananda Sagar University focuses on developing novel approaches to cybersecurity by leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence.

### Key Research Areas

**Quantum Teleportation for Secure Communication**

Quantum teleportation enables the transfer of quantum states between parties without physically transmitting the quantum system itself. This has profound implications for secure communication:

- Unconditional security based on physical laws
- Detection of eavesdropping attempts
- Integration with classical cryptographic protocols

**AI-based Risk Mitigation**

Artificial intelligence techniques are employed to:

- Predict and identify security vulnerabilities
- Automate threat detection and response
- Optimize cryptographic protocol selection

### Research Objectives

1. Develop a framework combining quantum teleportation with AI for enhanced security
2. Analyze the security implications of quantum computing on existing systems
3. Propose hybrid classical-quantum cryptographic solutions
4. Evaluate the practical implementation challenges

### Methodology

The research employs a combination of:

- Theoretical analysis of quantum protocols
- Simulation of quantum communication systems
- Machine learning models for risk assessment
- Comparative security analysis

### Expected Contributions

- Novel quantum-enhanced security protocols
- AI models for cryptographic vulnerability assessment
- Guidelines for post-quantum transition strategies
- Framework for quantum-classical hybrid systems
