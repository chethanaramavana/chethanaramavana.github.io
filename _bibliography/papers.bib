  abstract={This paper presents a comprehensive review of block cipher security in the context of emerging quantum computing threats. We analyze traditional block cipher constructions and evaluate their resilience against quantum attacks, particularly Grover's algorithm. The review covers post-quantum considerations and discusses strategies for maintaining cryptographic security in a quantum computing era.},
