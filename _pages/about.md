I am a PhD researcher at Dayananda Sagar University, Bengaluru, with a strong foundation in Mathematics. My research focuses on **Quantum Cryptography** and **Post-Quantum Cryptography**, bridging the gap between theoretical Linear Algebra and modern Cybersecurity applications.

My doctoral thesis explores **Cyber Security Risk Mitigation Using Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Teleportation**, investigating novel approaches to securing digital communications in the quantum era.

## Research Interests

My research spans several interconnected areas:

- **Quantum Computing & Cryptography**: Exploring the implications of quantum computing on existing cryptographic systems and developing quantum-resistant solutions.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Analyzing block ciphers and their security considerations in a post-quantum world.
- **Computational Complexity**: Studying Kolmogorov Complexity and its applications in cryptography.
- **One-way Functions**: Investigating the theoretical foundations of cryptographic primitives.

## Background

I hold an M.Sc. in Mathematics from Mangalore University, specializing in Real Analysis, Measure Theory, Functional Analysis, Linear Algebra, Topology, and Lattice Theory. I have been honored with fellowship programmes at both the **Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)** and the **Indian Institute of Science (IISc)** under the Indian Academy of Sciences.

My teaching experience spans multiple institutions, where I have taught undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Mathematics and Physics.
